    <h2>What is Front End Development?</h2>
    <div>Everything you see on a website, like buttons, links, animations, and more, were created by a front end web developer. It is the front end developer's job to take the vision and design concept from the client and implement it through code. Everything on the page from the logo to the search bar, buttons, overall layout and how the user interacts with the page was created by a front end developer. Front end developers are in charge of the look and feel of the website.
    Front end developers also have to make sure the website looks good on all devices (phones, tablets, and computer screens).</div>
    <h2>What Skills Do You Need to Become a Front End Developer?</h2>
    <div>The three main languages you need to know well are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From there you can focus on frameworks, libraries, and other useful tools.</div>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <div>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML displays the content on the page like buttons, links, headings, paragraphs, and lists.
    You should not use HTML for styling. That is what CSS is for.</div>
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <div>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is responsible for the style of your web page including colors, layouts, and animations. Responsive design is essential in creating websites that look good on all devices.</div>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <div>JavaScript allows users to interact with the web page. Examples of JavaScript can be found in virtually any web page. For example, when I click on the Menu button at the top of the page, it will open a dropdown list of options. Every time I click on that button, it will toggle back and forth between opening and closing the Menu.</div>
